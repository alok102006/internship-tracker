# Internship Tracker

A lightweight productivity web application designed to help students stay consistent while applying for internships.
The tracker records daily applications, maintains a streak system, and provides a simple checklist so users can build discipline during their internship search.

## About the Project

While preparing for internships, I realized that the real difficulty was not learning skills — it was maintaining consistency. Many students apply for a few days and then stop, losing momentum and motivation.

I built this project as a simple tool to encourage daily action. The application tracks progress, shows visible effort, and motivates users to apply regularly instead of sporadically.

The goal of this project is to turn internship preparation into a measurable daily habit.

## How It Works

The application stores user activity locally in the browser using LocalStorage.
Each day the checklist resets automatically while preserving the user's streak count. The progress bar updates in real time as tasks are completed, helping users visualize daily effort.

No backend or account is required — the app is fast, simple, and privacy-friendly.
